<b>Collection of Information</b><br>
We collect information that you voluntarily provide to us, such as your email address when creating an account, and information about your in-app purchases. We also collect information automatically when you use our app, such as device information, IP address, and usage data. We use Google Firebase and Google Sign-In to manage user accounts and game progress. We do not store any credit card information. All payments for in-app purchases are processed by the respective app stores (such as Apple App Store or Google Play Store) and are subject to their own privacy policies and terms of service. We do not have access to or store any of your credit card information.
</li>
<li>
<b>Use of Information</b><br>
We use the information we collect to manage your account and game progress, serve advertisements, and improve our app. We may use your email address to send you promotional messages or notifications about updates to our app. We use Google Firebase Analytics to analyze user behavior and track app crashes.
</li>
<li>
<b>Disclosure of Information</b><br>
We do not sell, rent, or lease your personal information to third parties. We may share your information with our service providers, such as Unity Ads, to serve advertisements and provide analytics services. We may also disclose your information if required by law or to protect our rights or property.
</li>
<li>
<b>Security</b><br>
We take reasonable measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security of your information.
